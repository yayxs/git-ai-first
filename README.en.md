## Git vs GitHub

Many people have probably heard of Git and GitHub. Let's briefly explain the difference between the two:

-   **Analogy of a diary:** Git is a free, open-source, distributed version control system. To put it simply, it can be understood as a diary, specifically for recording things. For example, you can record what happened today.
-   **Hub:** GitHub is a Hub, similar to a platform. You've probably heard of PornHub, which hosts a lot of videos. It's the same principle. GitHub stores code from all over the world.

## Quick Start

I don't know if knowledge about Git counts as programming-related. However, if you want to use AI for programming, I think the first step should be to understand what Git is. Why do I say that? Because it's like a diary that records the entire life of your code. It also records what code you write every day. This will be a valuable asset in the future. So in the age of AI, this is the first lesson.

Since we've mentioned two terms, Git and GitHub:

-   Go to https://github.com/ and register your own account. It is recommended to use a Google email address. Of course, if you don't know how to register, you are already using AI, so let AI help you. Or you can search for relevant information online step by step.
-   **Git:** This is something you install on your computer. Download Git here: https://git-scm.com/downloads

**Special note:** If you encounter problems with the above two steps, please use AI or search for information yourself. With a little patience, you can definitely solve it.

## Me and Git

I remember when I first started programming, I came across Git. And I also stored a lot of my own code. So I suggest that if you want to program, the first step should be to get ready with Git and GitHub. But at that time, I really didn't know what it meant. What exactly is Git? I actually learned it by watching videos before.

After working for many years, even now, there are still many Git uses that I don't know. However, this will no longer be important. Because we have AI.

I'm used to putting some of my code examples on GitHub. On the one hand, it's to record my learning. The most important point is to look at the code written now in the future, and to summarize the code written in the past now.

## For Example

When you see this, you should have a concept. What concept? A repository. The text, code, or any natural language we write on the computer should be placed in a folder. This folder can be regarded as a repository. We can store things in this repository and take things out. But it is important to remember that there is also a remote repository. We can also put things in and take things out of the remote repository.

## Specification

Every commit is like answering your girlfriend's question, you don't know how to better describe your commit message. When you look at an open source project, you will see that the commit messages are relatively standardized. But in general, there are several categories. A good, unified Git commit message specification is crucial for team collaboration, code maintenance, version rollback, and automatic generation of changelogs.

Currently, the most popular and widely used specification in the community is Conventional Commits. Its format is very structured and easy for machines to parse.

```
`type`: Used to indicate the category of this commit. Common types are:
       * feat: new feature
       * fix: fix Bug
       * docs: only modified the documentation
       * style: code format modification, does not affect the code logic (such as modifying spaces, semicolons, etc.)
       * refactor: code refactoring, no new features or bug fixes
       * test: add or modify test cases
       * chore: changes to the build process or auxiliary tools (such as modifying .gitignore)
       * perf: performance improvement changes
       * revert: revert the previous commit
```

Of course, some teams now use natural language from each conversation with AI as the commit message. An open source project from Cloudflare, workers-oauth-provider, is almost entirely generated by AI, and the project author attaches the prompt used in each commit.

## Git Config

```sh
git config user.name # View the current username

git config user.email # View the current email

git config --local user.name "yayxs" # Set the local username

git config --local user.email "yayxs@gmail.com" # Set the local email

git config --local --list  # View the local config
```

## Git Reset

```sh
git reset # Cancel the git add . operation
```

## Git Guide

> [git - the simple guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

```sh
# Create a clone of the local repository
# The repository on the remote server
git clone https://github.com/yayxs/git-learn.git
```

Workflow: Working Directory + Staging Area + HEAD

```sh
# Add to the staging area
git add <filename>
```

```sh
git commit -m "Code commit message" # After executing this command, the changes have been committed to HEAD
```

```sh
git push origin main # Push to the remote main branch
```

```sh
git checkout -b feature_x
# Push to the remote branch
git push origin feature_x
```

````sh
# Update the remote branch
 git pull <remote> <branch>
 git pull origin main
``

```sh
# Create a tag
git tag 1.0.0  35df273
````

```sh
# History of the local repository
git log

# View the record of a certain person
git log --author=yayxs

```

```sh
# Display all branches in a tree structure with ASCII art, with each branch marked with its name and tag
git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all
```

```sh
# Replace local changes, filename is the name of the changed file
git checkout -- <filename>
```

## A Little More Complicated

```sh
# Use the latest from the remote
git fetch --all && git reset --hard origin/main

Fetching origin
HEAD is now at 0d6ab89 The remote is the latest
```

```sh
git diff
# The difference between the working directory and the staging area

# Show the file changes between any two commits in the local repository

git diff id1 id2
```

```sh
# Show the local branch associated with the remote repository

git branch -vv
```

```sh
# All remote branches
git branch -r
origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  origin/feature1
  origin/feature_x
  origin/main
  origin/pr
  origin/rebase
```

```sh
# The correspondence between remote branches and local branches
git remote show origin

# Delete a local branch
git branch -d <local-branchname>
# Delete a remote branch
git push origin --delete <remote-branchname>
```

```sh
# View tags
git tag -ln
```

```sh
# Push all tags
git push origin --tags
```

## .github

The `.github` directory is usually used in a GitHub project to store configuration files for some features and tools provided by GitHub. The following are some of the files or subdirectories that may be included in the .github directory:

-   `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder: used to create issue templates
-   `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` folder: used to create pull request templates

## Git in the AI Era

In the AI era, you can ask AI to assist you with most Git operations, just like talking to a technical expert. The key is to give clear and specific instructions. Here are some prompt examples you can use directly to guide AI (like me) in Git management:

### 1. Project Initialization and Remote Repository Connection

When starting a new project from scratch, you can let AI complete the initialization and configuration.

> **Prompt Example (Initialization):**
> '''
> I want to create a new Git repository in the current directory. Please help me perform the initialization operation.
> '''

> **Prompt Example (Connecting to a remote repository):**
> '''
> I have already created an empty repository on GitHub at `https://github.com/user/repo.git`. Please help me associate the local repository with this remote repository.
> '''

> **Prompt Example (Configuring user information):**
> '''
> Please help me set the local user information for Git. My username is "Your Name" and my email is "your.email@example.com".
> '''

### 2. Checking Status and Preparing to Commit

After you have finished modifying some code or documents, you can ask AI to help you check the status and prepare for submission.

> **Prompt Example:**
> '''
> Check the status of the current repository to see which files I have modified. Then help me add all the modified files to the staging area and generate a commit message for me according to the 'Conventional Commits specification'.
> '''

### 3. Branch Management

Whether it's creating new features, fixing bugs, or organizing code, branching is a core concept. You can let AI handle complex branch operations for you.

> **Prompt Example:**
> '''
> I need to develop a new feature called 'user authentication'. Please help me create a new branch named `feat/user-authentication` and switch to this new branch.
> '''

> **Prompt Example (Merging branches):**
> '''
> The 'feat/user-authentication' branch has been developed and tested. Please help me merge it back into the `main` branch and delete this feature branch after the merge.
> '''

### 4. Viewing History and Logs

Want to review the project's change history or find a specific commit? AI can help you quickly filter information.

> **Prompt Example:**
> '''
> Please show me the last 5 commit records. I need to see the author, date, and full commit message for each commit.
> '''

> **Prompt Example (Searching for a specific commit):**
> '''
> I remember making a commit about 'database performance optimization' last week, but I forgot the details. Can you help me find that commit record?
> '''

### 5. Undo Operations

Wrote the wrong code or committed something you didn't want to commit? You can let AI help you safely undo the changes.

> **Prompt Example:**
> '''
> I just made a commit, but I found that it contains a password that should not have been committed. Please help me undo this commit, but keep the code changes I made so that I can correct them and recommit.
> '''

In this way, you no longer need to remember every specific Git command. Instead, you can describe your intentions in natural language and let AI be your Git assistant.
